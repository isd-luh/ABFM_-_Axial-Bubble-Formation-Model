# ABFM_-_Axial-Bubble-Formation-Model

- Model for representing the air bubble formation process in an axially symmetrical flow above a nozzle 
- The ABFM has been orginally developed to determine the bubble size distribution of bubble curtains produced by a nozzle hose.
- The ABFM bases on Bohne et al (2020). When you use the model, please cite this reference!
- Compatible with GNU Octave and Matlab
